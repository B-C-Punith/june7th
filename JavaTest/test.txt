	Java Test
	
1 
java is a object oriented language and it is platform independent language
javac is compiler ussed to run java programs and it  is present in the jdk bin,

2.
jdk is java tool kit that use run it contain jre 
and java devolopment kit it used to write the programs it contains libraries. 
jre is the java run time environment the provide environment to run the programs 
jvm is the java virtual machine it run and exicute the programs and and run the programs but it is a virtual machine it not seen,but it exist.

3.
Limitations of array
In array we can store only similer object 
we can not incres the size of the array 
We direct initization not possible 
we able sort the elements 

4.
class is the keyword and program block of code it can be run also it is blue print
object it is real world object that can be stored deal some function with it.
{} is the body of the program
class punith
{
	statement;
}

5.
Array is collection similer elements and elements stored in the [] and we can retrivie the elements by the indexes.

6.
java file 
java file is collection of code wriiten in java and it an only run in one os where it is written
class file is bite code genarated in the java compiler and and also it can run in any operating system thats make java platform independent.

7.
The length of the array 5.

8.
     public static void main(String [] anything)
	 {
	 
	 }
	  in the method public is the access specifire the gives access to the chaild class and user
	  static is the keyword non access spefire that  difines the it staic 
	  void  it is the return type it always points to the null values 
	  main is the name of the method 
	  String[] args is the parametrs declaration
	  flower brakets are body of the program
	  
9.
	java is object oriented language it is found by the jemes gosly and it use ussed in billions of computers 
	it is platform independent programing language.it run in any oerating system and it genarate the byte code it so it can run in any platform it contain jvc jvm jre. 

10.
 Variable is use to store the  refrence and it has 2 typles 
	local variable 
	global variable 
	instance variable
	local variable is declared in the  specific block and it only used in the only that spefic block only it can access only in side the block only.
	Global variable it is out side the block it can accses any where in the class so we call where we want also it store the  refrence of the adrees.
	instance variable is the variable declare in immediatly and use use specific period only.
 
 11.
  class variable is the variable declared in the class and it talso a global variable and it can accses any where .

 12.
 Data types 
 It defines what kind of the data can be stored
 it defines the varible and what kind of data can be stored in the variable 
 
 Types
 primitives datatypes
 nonprimitive datatypes
 
 primitives data types like
 int 
 it defines integer type of data can be stored in the varible it aloocates the 4 byte memory
 float
 it stores the floating values in the variable it allocates 4 byte memory
 double 
 it store the ratios and point values in the variable. it allocates 8 byte memory
 long 
 it stores the large  value  in the variables and used store values like phonenumbers.
boolean 
it stores only 2 values true or false or 1 and 0  it allocate 1 byte 
short 
it store the small values and it allocate 2 byte memory
 char 
 it stroes the single charecter and it allocates 2 bytes of memory

 Non premitive data types 

 String 
 It is a non premitive datatype it store the charecters 
 it is used to store the charecters the values are assigned by "" .
 
 
 13.
 Features of java
 java is object oriented programing language
 it is platform independent language because it genarate the byte code that can run in any platform.
 it genaretes byte code it can run in any platform
 it contain jdk jre jvm
 also it build inlibraries
 
 
 14.
 Array Types 
 integer []  it  stores integer valuese 
 String[] 	it stores the String values
 byte[]	    it stores the byte values
 double[]	it stores the long float values 
 float[]  it stores the floating values 
 long[] it store the large values
 
 15.
 The array is 5 indexes and we are trying to accesing the 6th elements it showes the array error
 
 16.
 System.out.println();
 
 it is statement udsed to print the statement 
 system is the predefined class  
 out is object 
 println name of the main

 17.
 Double equals used to comparing use
 eqaules use to initilaztion use
 
 18.
 dot operatoer is used invoke the functions
 
 19.
 base class of all the class is obejct
 
 20.
 public
 class
 void
static 
int 
double
string
return
null
float
